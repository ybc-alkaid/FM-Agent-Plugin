Install FM-Agent framework to the plugin data directory for automated code reasoning and bug detection.

## Overview

This skill clones FM-Agent from the official repository to the plugin data directory `$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/`. FM-Agent is a framework that realizes fully automated reasoning for large-scale systems using LLM-based Hoare-style verification.

## Installation Steps

For the following steps, exactly execute the provide bash commands. Do not run other commands or modify the provided commands.

If any step fails, stop the installation and inform the user to set up FM-Agent manually.

### Step 1: Ensure Plugin Data Directory Exists

Create `$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/` if it does not already exist (`mkdir -p` is a no-op when the directory is present):

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/
```

If `mkdir` fails (for example, due to permission errors), stop the installation and inform the user to set up FM-Agent manually.

### Step 2: Clone or Update FM-Agent

Clone FM-Agent to `$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent`, or update if it already exists:

```bash
if [ -d "$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent" ]; then
  echo "FM-Agent already exists, updating..."
  cd "$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent" && git pull
else
  echo "Cloning FM-Agent..."
  cd "$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/" && git clone https://github.com/fmagent-project/FM-Agent.git
fi
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run FM-Agent's install script to set up required dependencies:

```bash
"$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent/install.sh"
```

If the install script fails, stop the installation and inform the user to install manually.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

After cloning and installing dependencies, confirm FM-Agent is ready:

```bash
if [ -f "$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent/main.py" ]; then
  echo "FM-Agent installed successfully"
else
  echo "FM-Agent installation incomplete — main.py not found"
fi
```

### Step 5: Next Steps

After successful installation, inform the user:

```
FM-Agent installed successfully.

Next steps:
/fm-agent:config - Configure FM-Agent settings
/fm-agent:run-full - Run full-project FM-Agent analysis for current codebase
/fm-agent:run-incremental --incremental [<intent-msg>] - Run incremental FM-Agent analysis for current codebase
/fm-agent:diagnose - Diagnose bugs found by FM-Agent
```

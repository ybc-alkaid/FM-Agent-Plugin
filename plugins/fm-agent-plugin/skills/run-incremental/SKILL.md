Execute incremental FM-Agent analysis for the current project.

## Overview

This skill runs FM-Agent from the plugin data directory `$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent` against the current project directory (`./`) in incremental mode.

## Arguments

This skill takes exactly one argument:

- `--incremental`: run incremental analysis

Do not accept an intent-file argument from the user. The skill always generates the intent file from exported summary files written by `fm-agent:export`.

Rules:
- If `--incremental` is not supplied, stop and tell the user to run `/fm-agent:run-incremental --incremental`.
- If extra arguments are supplied, ignore them and run incremental analysis using the generated intent file.

## Invocation Modes

This file defines two explicit procedures:

- **Default direct-user mode:** the normal `/fm-agent:run-incremental --incremental` procedure for direct user invocations. It generates an intent file and launches FM-Agent in the background.
- **Orchestration mode:** a dedicated one-round verification procedure that `fm-agent:auto-fix` must follow when it needs deterministic incremental verification. It runs synchronously.

Mode selection is by entrypoint, not by implicit runtime caller detection:

- Normal `fm-agent:run-incremental` usage follows **default direct-user mode**.
- `fm-agent:auto-fix` must follow the **orchestration mode** section when it needs one incremental verification round.

## Prerequisites

- `/fm-agent:install` executed before to have FM-Agent installed in the plugin data directory `$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent/`
- `/fm-agent:config` executed before to set up necessary configuration
- `fm_agent/version.log` exists from a prior FM-Agent analysis
- `fm_agent_plugin/export-<short-commit>-summary.md` files exist for every commit after the last analyzed commit through `HEAD`

## Shared Setup

Use these setup steps before either invocation mode runs FM-Agent.

### Step 1: Check for API Key

Check whether `$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/.env` exists and contains the API key:

```bash
cat $HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/.env
```

If the file or the API key is missing, stop execution and ask the user to run `/fm-agent:config` to set up configuration.

### Step 2: Commit Pending Code Changes

Before running FM-Agent analysis, make sure all current code changes are committed so the analysis has a stable git baseline.

Check the working tree:

```bash
git status --short
```

If there are uncommitted project changes, commit them before continuing:

```bash
git add -A -- . ':!fm_agent/**' && { git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "chore: save changes before fm-agent analysis"; }
```

Rules:
- Include tracked, modified, deleted, and untracked project files in the commit.
- Do not commit the `fm_agent/` output directory created by prior analysis runs.
- If `git status --short` only reports files under `fm_agent/`, skip the commit and continue.
- If the commit fails, stop execution and report the failure; do not run FM-Agent analysis on an uncommitted working tree.
- If there are no uncommitted project changes, continue without creating a commit.

### Step 3: Generate Incremental Intent File

Generate the intent file from the export summaries for commits between the last analyzed commit and the current commit.

1. Read the base commit id from the last line of `fm_agent/version.log`:

```bash
tail -n 1 fm_agent/version.log
```

2. Read the current commit id from `HEAD`:

```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD
```

3. Enumerate commits after the base commit through the current `HEAD`, in chronological order:

```bash
git rev-list --reverse <base-commit>..HEAD
```

4. For each commit from Step 3, resolve its short id and require the matching exported summary file:

```bash
git rev-parse --short <commit>
test -r "fm_agent_plugin/export-<short-commit>-summary.md"
```

5. Concatenate all matching summary files into a generated intent file. Use the short form of the base and current commit ids in the file name:

```bash
mkdir -p fm_agent_plugin
{
  echo "# Incremental FM-Agent Intent"
  echo
  echo "Base analyzed commit: <base-commit>"
  echo "Current commit: <current-commit>"
  echo
  echo "Generated from exported summaries in chronological order."
  echo
  for commit in $(git rev-list --reverse <base-commit>..HEAD); do
    short_commit=$(git rev-parse --short "$commit")
    summary_file="fm_agent_plugin/export-${short_commit}-summary.md"
    echo "## Commit ${short_commit}"
    echo
    cat "$summary_file"
    echo
    echo
  done
} > "fm_agent_plugin/incremental-intent-<base-short-commit>-to-<current-short-commit>.md"
```

Use the generated file as `<intent-file>` when running FM-Agent.

Rules:
- If `fm_agent/version.log` is missing, empty, or unreadable, stop and report that incremental intent generation cannot determine the last analyzed commit.
- If the base commit from `fm_agent/version.log` is not a valid ancestor reference for the current repository, stop and report the invalid base commit.
- If there are no commits between the base commit and `HEAD`, stop and report that there are no exported summaries to combine.
- If any required `fm_agent_plugin/export-<short-commit>-summary.md` file is missing or unreadable, stop and report the missing summary files; do not run FM-Agent with a partial generated intent file.

## Default Direct-User Mode

Use this mode for normal callers and direct user requests.

### Step 4: Run Incremental FM-Agent Analysis

Run FM-Agent from the plugin data directory (`$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent`) to analyze the current project directory (`./`). Combine the env sourcing and the run into a single command so the API key is available to the subprocess.

```bash
source $HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/.env && uv run python $HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent/main.py ./ --incremental <intent-file>
```

Do not pass `--resume` with incremental analysis.

**Always launch this as a background task with `run_in_background: true`.** FM-Agent analysis can take a long time, from several minutes for small codebases to hours for large ones, so blocking the session is not acceptable. Capture the returned `task_id` so Step 5 can poll it for completion.

### Step 5: Notify User on Completion

After launching the background task, do **not** wait synchronously. Prefer handing off completion monitoring to a separate polling helper so the user can be notified when the run finishes.

- If the platform provides a polling helper such as a `loop` skill, invoke that helper and pass it the background task handle from Step 4. The helper should poll the task status at an interval appropriate to the expected runtime (for example, 5 minutes for small projects, 15-30 minutes for large ones, or 10 minutes by default)
- If no polling helper is available on the platform, return immediately after launch and tell the user that FM-Agent incremental analysis is running in the background, and that they can run `/fm-agent:diagnose` after the run finishes.

## Orchestration Mode For `fm-agent:auto-fix`

Use this mode only when the caller is `fm-agent:auto-fix`.

This mode exists so the caller can treat one incremental FM-Agent run as one deterministic verification round. Do not reuse the default background flow and do not start a polling loop.

### Step 4: Run Exactly One Incremental Verification Round

Run FM-Agent from the plugin data directory (`$HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent`) against the current project directory (`./`) with the generated intent file and no resume flag:

```bash
source $HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/.env && uv run python $HOME/.fm-agent-plugin/FM-Agent/main.py ./ --incremental <intent-file>
```

Run this synchronously for orchestration mode. Wait for the command to exit before continuing.

This command exit is **not** the completion check by itself. A round is complete only after Step 5 succeeds.

### Step 5: Completion Check and Artifact Readiness

After the FM-Agent command exits, verify that:

- the command exited successfully, and
- `fm_agent/bug_validation/summary.json` exists and is readable

Use:

```bash
[ -r "fm_agent/bug_validation/summary.json" ] && echo "READY" || echo "MISSING"
```

- If both conditions hold, the incremental verification round succeeded and `fm_agent/bug_validation/summary.json` is ready for the caller to read immediately.
- If either condition fails, treat the round as failed. Do not claim that verification artifacts are ready.

### Step 6: Report Success vs Failure To The Caller

Return control to `fm-agent:auto-fix` only after the Step 5 completion check finishes.

- **Success:** state that one incremental verification round completed successfully and that `fm_agent/bug_validation/summary.json` is ready to read.
- **Failure:** state that the incremental verification round failed, include whether the FM-Agent command failed or `fm_agent/bug_validation/summary.json` was missing/unreadable, and do not describe the summary as ready.
